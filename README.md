# How Amplitude Analitycs Works
SUGGEST EDITS
To understand how Amplitude works, let’s walk through a hypothetical example.

Tunes is a standard music player for mobile devices that has common actions like playing a song, skipping a song, shuffling play, and sharing a song.

Using Amplitude, you can track all the actions your users make in detail and better understand what’s working and what’s not.

## What actions will Amplitude keep track of?
Amplitude gives you the power to determine what’s important to your experience. You can choose to track anything and everything.

For example, in Tunes, you could track the music control buttons the users presses or even how many songs each user has listened to in each session.

## Events represent actions users have taken
Every time an action happens that you wish to keep track of, you send an Event to Amplitude. Events can be as easy as choosing the text string that defines them.
For example, in Tunes, you could send an “Play Song” event every time a user presses the Play button.
